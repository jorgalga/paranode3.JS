# paranode3.JS
Paranode3JS is an attempt to combine the possibilities of the websockets in node.js with 
Three.js in order to get parallel rendered environments. This is a review of the idea
of the C++ library called Equalizer but applied to the HTML5 technologies. One of the main targets of this project
would be to develop a framework to create scalable videoWalls syncronized through the 
local network.
